# Knowledge-Graph-Implementation-Using-Neo4j-and-LLM-with-GroqLPU and Langchain


This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the integration of a Neo4j knowledge graph with language models using LangChain.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Install Required Packages

The first step is to install the necessary Python packages. Run the following commands in the notebook to install them:

```python
!pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain langchain-community langchain-groq neo4j
!pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain_experimental
```

### 2. Set up your Neo4j Environment

https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/

Create new Instance and open the playground

### 3. Set up your Groq LPU API for faster Inference

Get your Groq API Key from here -

https://console.groq.com/keys

### 4. Run the cells in the Notebook, after configuring Neo4j and Groq to create the Graph Database, Integrate the Neo4j graph with LangChain for further operations. This typically involves querying the graph and integrating with language models, although specific operations are not detailed in the notebook snippet provided.

### 5. LangChain interacts with the knowledge graph and generate responses using a language model. This step is generally custom to your application needs and involves creating prompts and using the language model to process them.
